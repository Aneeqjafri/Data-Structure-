# 🌳 **Binary Tree Traversal Program in C**

Welcome to the **Binary Tree Traversal Project** — a complete educational program that demonstrates how **binary trees** are created and traversed in the **C language**.  

This project is a perfect blend of **data structures, recursion, and memory management**, designed for students, beginners, and enthusiasts who wish to explore how binary trees work internally. 🌿

## 📘 **Project Overview**

This project allows you to:
- Build a **binary tree structure** interactively by entering nodes.
- Traverse the tree using **three popular traversal methods**:
  - **Inorder (Left → Root → Right)**
  - **Preorder (Root → Left → Right)**
  - **Postorder (Left → Right → Root)**

The program is **menu-driven**, meaning you can choose operations easily through an interactive console interface.  
It’s a **great hands-on exercise** for understanding **recursion**, **pointers**, and **dynamic memory allocation** in C.

## 🚀 **Features**

🌿 **Manual Tree Creation** — You can insert nodes interactively using a simple console interface.  
⚡ **Three Traversal Modes** — Explore Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder traversals easily.  
💾 **Dynamic Memory Allocation** — No static array limits — the tree grows as needed using `malloc()`.  
🧠 **Recursive Implementation** — Each traversal is implemented recursively, helping you master the logic.  
🖥️ **Fully Portable** — Works perfectly on **GCC, Code::Blocks, and VS Code**.  
📚 **Educational Design** — Built for students learning **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

**🧩 Step 1 — Creating a Tree**

When you select “1. Create Tree”, you are prompted to enter an integer.
You can then decide whether to add the next node as a left or right child.

**🧩 Step 2 — Traversals**

You can perform:

Inorder Traversal: Visits Left → Root → Right

Preorder Traversal: Visits Root → Left → Right

Postorder Traversal: Visits Left → Right → Root
